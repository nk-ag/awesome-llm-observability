The tooling for watching LLM apps in production is a fast-moving mess of overlapping projects, and every list I found had stars from 2023 on it. So I kept my own, verified the entries, and wired up a job to keep the numbers honest. Use it to find the right tool without re-researching the whole space.

**Legend:** 🟢 open-source · 🔵 open-core / hybrid · 🟠 commercial (public repo is an SDK/client only - low star counts don't reflect the product). Star counts are pulled live from the GitHub API and **auto-refreshed weekly by CI** ([tools/refresh_stars.py](tools/refresh_stars.py)), so they stay current instead of rotting.

## What is LLM Observability?

Regular observability assumes your system is deterministic. LLM apps aren't. They make things up, drift as inputs change, quietly burn tokens, and fail without ever throwing an error. So you end up watching different things:

- tracing: every step of a run, with tokens, latency, and cost per span
- evals: whether the output is actually any good, both offline and on live traffic
- monitoring: alerts when quality, cost, latency, or error rate move
- prompt and dataset management: version your prompts, and pull real production cases back into your tests

People call this LLMOps observability, AI observability, or just LLM monitoring. Same idea.

## 🧰 Skills (Batteries Included)

Most lists stop at links. This one also ships 26 [agent skills](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/agents-and-tools/agent-skills/overview), the `SKILL.md` kind, so your coding agent knows how to actually do this stuff instead of just knowing where the tools live. They fire on plain requests like "add tracing" or "reduce my LLM bill".

A handful (marked ⚙️) are backed by real Python with unit tests that run in CI. The rest ship trigger cases and get checked by [skillvitals](https://github.com/ContextJet-ai/skillvitals), a small tool I built to measure whether a skill actually fires when it should. A free heuristic runs on every push as a regression gate.

Graded on a cheap model (llama-3.1-8b via NVIDIA NIM), the 26 skills average a trigger F1 of 0.99 (98.7% recall, 0% false-fire), and that holds even against adjacent negatives, prompts about a *different* LLM task the skill should refuse to fire on. It's not a clean sweep though. `choose-observability-stack` came in at 0.80 because the model kept confusing a "compare Langfuse vs Phoenix" prompt with the model-comparison skill. That's exactly the kind of overlap this is meant to catch. Run it yourself:

```bash
skillvitals trigger skills/reduce-llm-cost/SKILL.md \
  --cases validation/cases/reduce-llm-cost.yaml \
  --model meta/llama-3.1-8b-instruct --base-url https://integrate.api.nvidia.com/v1
```

### Install (about 10 seconds)

**As a Claude Code plugin (easiest):**
```
/plugin marketplace add ContextJet-ai/awesome-llm-observability
/plugin install llm-observability@contextjet
```

**Or copy the skills into any agent's skills folder:**
```bash
npx degit ContextJet-ai/awesome-llm-observability/skills ~/.claude/skills
```

**Or clone and run the installer:**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/ContextJet-ai/awesome-llm-observability
./awesome-llm-observability/install.sh          # installs into ~/.claude/skills
```

## Evaluation Frameworks

Test and score LLM/agent output. One thing to sort out before you pick a tool: are you doing **offline/batch** evals (run over a dataset in CI to optimize a prompt) or **inline** evals (score a response live, to gate or block it before it reaches the user)? They're pretty different jobs. Most of the frameworks below are built for the offline case. Live gating usually lands in the [guardrails](#guardrails--safety-monitoring) tools or a platform's online-scoring feature.

## Guides & Tools (Original)

Original work in this repo, not just curated links:

- 🧰 **[Agent Skills](skills/)** - 26 ready-to-run workflows (instrument, evals, debug-from-traces, guardrails, PII-safe tracing, tool selection).
- 📖 **[LLM Observability for Finance & Regulated Industries](guides/llm-observability-for-finance.md)** - a guide for teams where observability is a *compliance control*, not a dashboard.
- 🛠️ **[`genai_trace.py`](tools/genai_trace.py)** - a minimal vendor-neutral OpenTelemetry GenAI tracer with a PII-redaction hook.

## How to Choose

- **Just need traces + cost, minimal code?** Start with a **gateway/proxy** (change base URL, zero SDK) or a tracing platform with OTel auto-instrumentation.
- **Need to *test* quality, not just watch it?** Add an **evaluation framework** (offline eval in CI + online LLM-as-a-judge).
- **Data residency / on-prem required?** Pick from [Self-Hosted](#self-hosted--open-source-first).
- **Want vendor-neutral, future-proof traces?** Emit **OTel GenAI semantic conventions** so you can swap backends.

A common production setup pairs a **gateway** (cost + routing) with an **evaluation tool** (quality) on top of an **OTel-native tracing** backbone.

### What it actually costs to run (self-hosted)

The feature tables above don't tell you what you're signing up to operate, and that's usually the
thing that decides it. Roughly three tiers:

| Tier | Backing services | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **Single process** | SQLite or one Postgres | Phoenix, MLflow. One container, no OLAP store. Easiest to run. |
| **Postgres-class** | Postgres (+ object storage for artifacts) | MLflow with a tracking server, Latitude. Ordinary web-app operations. |
| **OLAP-class** | ClickHouse + Postgres + Redis/Valkey + S3-compatible blob storage | Langfuse v3/v4, Opik, Helicone, SigNoz. Four moving parts, not one. |

**Why ClickHouse keeps showing up:** high-volume span ingest with analytical queries over it is a
column-store workload, and Postgres degrades on it. It's driven by *tracing* throughput, not by
evals - if you don't need tracing, the whole tier is avoidable. ClickHouse is a hard requirement
for self-hosted Langfuse; there's no Postgres-only mode.

**Is a single, non-replicated ClickHouse enough?** For development and low-volume production,
yes - it runs fine on one node, and that's what the docker-compose quickstarts give you
(`CLICKHOUSE_CLUSTER_ENABLED=false`). Understand what you're trading: a single node has no
redundancy, so node loss means trace loss, which is why Langfuse labels single-container Docker
development-only rather than slow. For production they suggest 3 ClickHouse replicas plus 3
Keeper nodes, ~2 CPU / 8-16 GiB each. Disk is the thing that bites - observability data grows
fast, so set a retention policy on day one and use a volume you can expand.

**If that's more than you want to operate:** stay in the single-process tier (Phoenix for
tracing + evals, MLflow if you're already on it), or run evals in CI with a framework that keeps
no server at all and reach for a hosted backend only when you actually need trace history.
